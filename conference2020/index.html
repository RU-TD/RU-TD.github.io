<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs01" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Understanding the first steps in the formation of stars and protoplanetary disks is a great unsolved problem of modern astrophysics. The key to make progress on this topic is to confront theoretical models and high-resolution studies of the youngest protostars, observed less than 0.1 Myrs after the onset of protostellar formation. 
I will present the recent work carried in the MagneticYSOs team, starting from our earlier results suggesting that >75% of the youngest protostellar disks are only found at very small radii &lt;60 au (Maury+ 2019). I will also describe our kinematic analysis of envelope rotation (Gaudel+ 2020), which conservation of angular momentum is traditionally blamed for the formation of disks, and present how these observations and new numerical models (Verliat+ 2020) question this well-established paradigm.  I will discuss how these observations, coupled to our detection of magnetic fields (Maury+ 2018, Galametz+ 2018, Le Gouellec+ 2019, Galametz+ sub.) favor a scenario of magnetically regulated protostellar disk formation.
Finally, since magnetic fields are routinely mapped thanks to dust polarized emission, we have also investigated the dust properties in young protostars to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the polarization (Guillet et al. 2020, Le Gouellec et al. sub.). Confronting our observations against synthetic observations of protostellar MHD models, we were able to show that large (>10 -100 microns) dust grains are required to (i) produce polarized dust emission at levels similar to those currently observed in solar-type protostars at millimeter wavelengths (Valdivia+ 2019), and (ii) explain the variations of dust emissivity observed in protostellar envelopes (Galametz+ 2019).

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs02" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: A first step towards understanding planetary formation is the characterisation of the structure and evolution of protoplanetary discs. A variety of planetary systems has been discovered in recent years and it likely depends on the early history of their formation. Thus, understanding the chemical composition of early solar-like protostars is crucial. To be able to study the lines in detail though, a good knowledge of the dust properties and in particular the optical depth is needed in order to interpret the lines correctly.
In this talk I want to present our results of the class I source Elias29 as part of the FAUST (fifty au study of the chemistry in the disk/envelope system of solar-like protostars) collaboration. The goal of FAUST is to quantify the chemical composition of the envelope/disk system of solar-lie class 0 and I protostars. With the high spatial resolution of 50 au in band 3 and band 6 ALMA data we can spatially resolve the envelope and the disk on this source and calculate the dust properties of the two components.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs03" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: The prevalence of ring-like disk substructures has been interpreted as either consequence of or precursor to planet formation. We explore the latter scenario by focusing on the dynamics of gas and dust in outer regions of protoplanetary disks (beyond ~10 AU). In this region, gas dynamics is strongly affected by ambipolar diffusion (AD) as the dominant non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect. We conduct 3D high-resolution global non-ideal MHD simulations with net poloidal magnetic flux over a wide range of AD coefficients. We show that the disk launches magnetized winds from surface while the bulk disk is weakly turbulent due to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We further robustly demonstrate that magnetic flux spontaneously concentrates to localized radii randomly spaced on scales of several disk scale heights, driving “zonal flows” exhibited as ring-like structures. We then conduct local non-ideal MHD simulations of a weakly MRI-turbulent disk with forced zonal flows and dust particles. We show that when enabling dust feedback, particle concentration into zonal flows is subject to breaking up to form small dust clumps, whose densities can be sufficiently high towards planetesimal formation. The results imply a pathway for earliest stage of planet formation from magnetically-induced substructures.</td><td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs04" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: The recent developments in our understanding of the chemical composition, the ionisation equilibrium and the dynamics of protoplanetary discs has led to the conclusion that magnetised disc wind (MDW) are probably playing an important role in shaping the long term evolution of these objects. Most of our understanding of these winds comes from global direct numerical simulations which include complex microphysics and which explore only a very limited subspace of parameters. Hence, it is very difficult to draw firm conclusions about the long-term evolution of discs subject to MDW.
In this contribution, I will present a systematic exploration of MDW solutions, which can then be used in secular models to predict the evolution of a disc, in a way similar to the "alpha disc" model. I will also discuss the solutions topology (top/down symmetry, midplane/surface accretion layers, laminar stress, etc...) which have often been mis-interpreted in the literature.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs05" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: In recent years, the increasing number of high-resolution observations revealed that various sub-structures are a common feature of circumstellar disks. Apart from prominent annular ring structures, several stars host disks that are associated with shadows. Many of these features are likely caused by an inner disk casting a shadow on a misaligned outer disk. Additionally, observations of arc-like structures and luminosity bursts of stars >1 Myr in age indicate that at least some stars undergo late infall events. Considering the possibility of late infall events on an already existing star-disk system, we investigate the scenario, whether such infall events can lead to the formation of a second-generation, outer disk that is misaligned with respect to the inner primordial disk. Carrying out 3D hydrodynamical models with the moving-mesh code AREPO, we show that an outer disk can form around the inner disk as a consequence of a late infall event. For the scenario that the infalling cloudlet of gas has a different orientation of angular momentum than the primordial disk, the new outer disk is misaligned with respect to the inner disk. Using the results of the hydrodynamical models, we produce synthetic observations of polarized dust emission using the radiative transfer code POLARIS. In agreement with observations, the results show the presence of shadows in the outer disks that are induced by the presence of the inner disk. Finally, the synthetic observations show a lower dust temperature in the shadow than in the illuminated part of the outer disk, which can possibly be observed and used to infer more information about the properties at the smaller scales of the inner disk.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs06" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: One of the key physical processes that plays a role in the evolution of a protoplanetary disk is the mass loss, likely determined by photoevaporative winds driven by the central star or magnetic-driven winds. Both processes could lead to cavities in the disk and finally cause the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Despite the widely recognised importance of this mass loss process, as of today, there are no effective diagnostic methods to determine the properties of the wind from the observations. I will present the challenging of modelling the thermochemical properties of the wind and its launching region to infer observational properties, accounting for the interplay between microphysics, chemistry, and dynamics.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs07" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Spatially resolved continuum observations of planet-forming disks show prominent ring and gap structures in their dust distribution. However, the picture from gas observations is much less clear and constraints on the radial gas density structure (i.e. gas gaps) remain rare and uncertain. We want to investigate the importance of thermo-chemical processes for the interpretation of high-spatial-resolution gas observations of planet-forming disks and their impact on derived gas properties. We apply the radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to model self-consistently the dust and gas disk of HD 163296, using the DSHARP gas and dust observations. With this model we investigate the impact of dust gaps and gas gaps, considering chemistry and heating/cooling processes, on the observables and the derived gas properties. We find distinct peaks in the radial line intensity profiles of the CO line data of HD 163296 at the location of the dust gaps. Our model indicates that those peaks are not only a consequence of a gas temperature increase within the gaps but are mainly caused by the absorption of line emission from the back side of the disk by the dust rings. For two of the three prominent dust gaps in HD 163296, we find that thermo-chemical effects are negligible for deriving density gradients via measurements of the rotation velocity. However, for the gap with the highest dust depletion, the temperature gradient can be dominant and needs to be considered to derive accurate gas density profiles. Self-consistent gas and dust thermo-chemical modelling in combination with high-quality observations of multiple molecules are necessary to accurately derive gas gap depths and shapes. This is crucial to determine the origin of gaps and rings in planet-forming disks and to improve the mass estimates of forming planets if they are the cause of the gap.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs08" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Polarimetric observations of protoplanetary disks at millimeter wavelengths have been dramatically developing owing to high-sensitivity and high-resolution observations with ALMA. However, the mechanisms of the polarization are under discussion. The possible mechanisms proposed so far are the self-scattering or the grain alignment with magnetic fields, with radiation fields, or with gas drag. In this talk, I will quickly review the current understandings of millimeter-wave polarization and discuss the grain properties especially on the disks around HL Tau and HD 142527. The HL Tau disk has shown a smooth transition from self-scattering polarization at ALMA Band 7 to alignment-induced polarization at ALMA Band 3. However, our detailed modeling has revealed that the Band 3 polarization is a mixture of scattering and alignment, which allows us to model it with grains as large as millimeter size. The HD 142527 disk shows different polarization patterns between ALMA Band 7 and 4. We have shown that the polarization is qualitatively consistent with the azimuthal dust trapping scenario.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs09" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Dispersal time of protoplanetary disks is an essential parameter for planet formation—it constraints available time for planets to accrete the disk materials and affects the initial configuration of planetary systems. Infrared observations have estimated typical dispersal time of protoplanetary disks to be less than about 10 Myr and have proposed that it depends on systems' physical properties such as host-star mass, circumstellar environments, and metallicity. Since any planets form our of disk materials, investigating the physical properties' dependence can give clues to understand the origins of the wide variety of exoplanets. 
Photoevaporation is one of the significant dispersal processes for protoplanetary disks. Prior theoretical works show that the stellar ultraviolet and X-ray can yield a significant mass loss rate consistent with the observational disk lifetimes. Photoevaporation is a process determined by hydrodynamics, radiation, and chemistry mutually affecting on a similar timescale. Therefore, simultaneously solving these physics is essential. We have developed a radiation hydrodynamics code that implements self-consistent thermochemistry to study the dependencies of photoevaporation on the system's properties, such as metallicity, dust growth, and stellar mass. In this talk, we present our recent results of the radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We also discuss the relevance of our results to transitional/debris disks and implications of our results to the observational statistics of disk lifetimes.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs10" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract:
Photoevaporation of planet-forming discs by high-energy irradiation from the central star is a crucial mechanism for disc evolution and dispersal,  and it may play an important role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
We present here a new generation of X-ray photoevaporation models for different stellar masses (and X-ray luminosities), based on hydrodynamical simulations at different stages of disc evolution, which account for stellar irradiation via a significantly improved parametrization of gas temperatures, based on detailed photoionization and radiation transfer calculations.
Our two-dimensional hydrodynamical models are then used to derive simple recipes for the mass-loss rates that are suitable for one-dimensional disc evolution and/or planet formation models typically employed for population synthesis studies. Line profiles from typical wind diagnostics (OI 6300Å and NeII 12.8 μm) are also calculated for our models and found to be roughly in agreement with previous studies.
Finally, we perform a population study of transition discs by means of one-dimensional viscous evolution models including our new photoevaporation prescription and find that roughly a half of observed transition disc cavities and accretion rates could be reproduced by X(EUV) photoevaporation.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs12" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Transition discs with evacuated inner cavities are expected to be a natural outcome of the interplay between X-ray driven photoevaporation (XPE) and giant planet formation. Massive planets can reduce the inflow of material from the outer to the inner disc, therefore triggering the earlier onset of disc dispersal due to photoevaporation through a process known as Planet Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE, Rosotti+ 2013). In this case, cavities are formed as material inside the planetary orbit is removed by photoevaporation, leaving only the outer disc to drive the migration of the giant planet. We investigate the impact of XPE on giant planet migration, and focus specifically on the case of transition discs with evacuated inner cavities inside the planet location. This is important to determine under what circumstances photoevaporation is efficient at halting the migration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a population of planets. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations to model the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition discs subject to XPE. The results are then compared to the migration tracks of planets obtained by the impulse approximation, which is commonly employed in 1D planet population synthesis approaches. The 2D FARGO simulations show that once the disc inside the planet location gets depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This contradicts the results obtained by the impulse approximation in 1D, which predicts strong, accelerated inward migration of planets in discs that have been cleared inside the planetary orbit. These results suggest that the impulse approximation may not be suitable to describe the migration of planets embedded in transition discs with inner cavities.

Gas emission profiles and sizes are estimated on ~40 disks of the sample. These gas properties are then compared to the dust properties of the same objects, estimated using analogous methodology. The results for the Lupus disk sample confirm a larger gas size when compared to the dust size. The median of the gas/dust size ratio 2.5. This size difference can be explained by effective drifting of dust, but also by the optical depth difference between 12CO and dust continuum. Disentangling between these two effects is in general difficult; only large size ratios (typically beyond 4) unequivocally exhibit prominent dust evolution. Only a small fraction (~20%) of the Lupus disk population has such a large size ratio. I will also discuss possible correlations between the size ratio and other stellar/disk properties.

We calculate the disk continuum emission and the effective radius for all models as a function of time. We simulate three different cases: a smooth disk surface density profile, one with pressure bumps, and one that include planets. By selecting only the disks that lie on the observed size-luminosity relation, we constrain the parameter range and search for trends between the initial conditions and the survival frequency of every disk. By applying neural networks, we determine the influence of every parameter on the final outcome, showing significant results for the initial disk mass, the turbulence-parameter alpha, the planet mass, and the stellar mass. We will further investigate which initial conditions are in agreement with the disks we observe today and will apply our dynamical models to fit individual disks.

Previous works suggest how an independent mass estimate can be obtained by linking the radial extent of multiwavelenght continuum observations (referred to as ”dust lines”) and the disk surface density distribution, assuming that dust evolution is dominated by drift. I will present results of theoretical studies testing the assumptions necessary to link dust lines with disk masses, in particular including traps and gaps to the disk structure. When the disk presents prominent structures, the dust evolution is determined by particle trapping and the relation between dust line location and disk mass breaks apart. However, if the bumps are weaker, the dust evolution will still be globally drift dominated, and we maintain a strong correlation between disk mass and dust line location. As a practical application I will compare the model results with real disks: a disk with an overall smooth density distribution such as TW Hya, and a disk with prominent features, AS 209.

Several recent studies show that the standard assumptions for both of these quantities are likely incorrect. I will report on our new set of models that reconcile theory with observations of protoplanetary disks and create a new set of initial conditions for planet formation models. This modeling makes use of recent resolved multiwavelength observations of disks in the millimeter to constrain the aerodynamic properties of dust grains, allowing us to infer total disk mass without an assumed dust opacity or tracer-to-H2 ratio. The 7 disks modeled using this method thus far are close to the limit of gravitational stability at certain radii and raise the possibility that all disks are more massive than has been previously appreciated.  I will also present on work that combines the microphysics of cloud formation in planetary atmospheres and our new models of protoplanetary disks to show that the observed depletion of CO in 4 well-studied disks is consistent with freeze-out processes and that the variable CO depletion observed in disks can be explained by the processes of freeze-out and particle drift. This work both solves an outstanding problem in observations of protoplanetary disks and robustly constrains the C-to-O ratio in gas and solids available for planet formation.

But at the same time, the revolutionary ALMA datasets are important for another reason: they allow us to characterise the environment in which planets form. This characterisation is of fundamental importance to understand planet formation: the disc environment determines how planets accrete solids and grow to the point of eventually becoming observable. I will show through various examples of my work how to conduct this characterisation. I will focus in particular on the question of how turbulent these discs are and the related question of whether turbulence (or, as frequently called in this context, viscosity) is the dominant mechanism of angular momentum transport. To tackle these questions, I will illustrate two different approaches. The first one consists in using the measurements of the bulk properties, such as masses, radii and mass accretion rates, now available for large samples of discs. The existence of a correlation between mass accretion rates and disc masses suggests that discs evolution is driven by turbulence/viscosity. However, we can exclude that discs are highly turbulent, as shown for example by the small sizes of the bulk of the disc population. The second approach consists in a detailed view of individual discs. I will show in particular how the analysis of the disc gas rotation curve is a powerful way to measure the amount of turbulence. The discs for which this analysis is possible are compatible with having a low degree of turbulence, but in this case grain growth cannot have proceeded beyond mm-size.

It has been suggested that this depletion is a signpost of planet formation. The exoplanet statistics are now good enough to show that the origin of this depletion does not arise from the sequestration of refractory material inside the planets themselves. This conclusion arises because most sun-like stars host close-in planetary systems that are on average more massive than the Sun's. Using evolutionary models for the protoplanetary discs that surrounded the young Sun and solar twins, we demonstrate that the origin of the depletion likely arises due to formation of a transition disc via the trapping of dust exterior to the orbit of a forming giant planet. In this scenario, a forming giant planet opens a gap in the gas disc, creating a pressure trap. If the planet forms early enough, while the disc is still massive, the planet can trap ≳100 M⊕ of dust exterior to its orbit, preventing the dust from accreting on to the star in contrast to the gas. Forming giant planets can create refractory depletions of ∼ 5-15 per cent, with the larger values occurring for initial conditions that favour giant planet formation (e.g. more massive discs that live longer). The incidence of solar twins that show refractory depletion matches both the occurrence of giant planets discovered in exoplanet surveys and `transition' discs that show similar depletion patterns in the material that is accreting on to the star.

This has given rise to the question of whether these substructures are triggered by planet-disc interactions. Besides direct imaging, one of the most promising methods to distinguish between different disc shaping mechanisms is to study the gas content of the disc in terms of its kinematics. Apart from `kinks` in the iso-velocity contours, the deviations of the rotation profile from Keplerian velocity can be used to probe perturbations in the gas pressure profile that might be caused by embedded (proto-) planets. In this work we analyze the gas brightness temperature and kinematics of the transitional disc around the nearby, intermediate mass star CQ Tau in order to resolve and characterize substructure in the gas, caused by possible perturbers. For our analysis we use spatially resolved ALMA observations of the three CO isotopologues 12CO, 13CO and C18O (J=2-1) from the disc around CQ Tau. We further extract robust line centroids for each channel map and fit a number of Keplerian disc models to the velocity field. The gas kinematics of the CQ Tau disc present non-Keplerian features, showing bent and twisted iso-velocity curves in 12CO. Significant spiral structure is detected in both the brightness temperature and the rotation velocity after subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric model, which may be tracing planet-disc interactions with an embedded planet or low-mass companion. We identify three spirals, two in the brightness temperature and one in the velocity, spanning a large azimuth and radial extent. A symmetric pair of shadows may be present in both the integrated and peak intensity, which may be indicative of an inner disc misaligned with respect to the outer disc.  The kinematics are however strongly dominated by the spiral feature, making it difficult to constrain any characteristics of smaller features like this potential warp.

Characterizing the origin of asymmetries as seen in HD 163296 might lead to a better understanding of planet formation and the underlying physical parameters of the system. We test the possibility of the formation of the crescent shaped asymmetry in the HD 163296 disk through planet disk interaction. The goal is to obtain constraints on planet masses and eccentricities and disk viscosities. Methods. Two dimensional, multi-fluid, hydrodynamical simulations are performed with the FARGO3D code including three embedded planets. Dust is described with the pressureless fluid approach and is distributed over eight size bins. Resulting grids are post-processed with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D and the CASA software to model synthetic observations. We find that the asymmetry can be qualitatively modeled with a Jupiter mass planet at a radial distance of 48 au. Dust is trapped preferably in the trailing Lagrange point L5 with a mass of 10 to 15 earth masses. The observation of such a feature confines the level of viscosity and planetary mass. Increased values of eccentricity of the innermost Jupiter mass planet damages the stability of the asymmetric feature and does not reproduce the observed radial proximity to the first prominent ring in the system. Generally, a low level of viscosity (α ≤ 2 · 10−3) is necessary to allow the existence of such an asymmetry. Including dust feedback the leading point L4 can dominantly capture dust for dust grains with an initial Stokes number ≤ 3.6 · 10−2 corresponding to a grain size of ≈ 5 mm. Masses larger than ≈ 0.5 Jupiter masses for the second planet at 83 au may lead to vortices and asymmetric dust trapping instead.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs33" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: PDS 70 is the only disk known to date that hosts two massive planets clearing a large cavity in the dust distribution. The planets have been detected in both infrared and Halpha, indicating that they are still actively accreting from the planet-hosting environment. The elemental composition of the growing planetary atmospheres are bound to be related to the composition of the accreting material. Bright molecular lines of simple chemical species can be used to infer chemical properties of the material that is being accreted by the planets (as C/O and C/N ratios), as well as physical processes presently occurring in the disk (shocking of gas onto the circumplanetary disks, ionisation). In this talk, I will show new ALMA band 6 observations of PDS 70 at moderate angular resolution in two spectral settings targeting HCN and CO isotopologues, small hydrocarbons, H2CO, H13CO+ and simple S bearing molecules. The molecular emission is particularly bright, with 15 molecular lines detected and imaged. The radial and azimuthal structures of the different molecules provide unique information on the chemical and physical conditions of PDS 70.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs34" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: We present a systematic study that quantifies potential observables from kinematical effects of embedded planets in discs. Our leading analysis focuses on investigating deviations from Keplerian rotation as a function of planet mass and location from an observational perspective. For this purpose, we employ original machinery that produces synthetic observations from FARGO simulations of planet-disc interactions and extracts disc observables by modelling channel maps from optically thick tracers. Other relevant parameters, such as disc mass, scale-height and inclination, dust content and radiation field strength, as well as observational biases, will be shortly included in the discussion. Furthermore, I will briefly summarise the main features of our radiative transfer machinery and parametric fitting tool for channel maps, which are also well suited to derive large-scale features in discs such as gaps, spirals and misalignments, or to describe radial and vertical temperature structure, relevant for disc evolution and planet formation processes.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs35" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Type II transition disks feature large inner holes or gaps that can stretch out to a few tens of au while substantial mass accretion onto the central star is maintained at the same time. This requires mass to flow through the gap. A natural choice for a possible explanation is a system of embedded planets which carves the gap and might provide a mechanism for mass to traverse it. In this talk, I will present two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of a flat disk with a system of two embedded planets and explain how outward migration can explain the simultaneous existence of large inner holes and substantial stellar accretion. Additionally, I will show synthetic images of the disks to illustrate how changes in the dynamical state of the planet-disk systems can lead to a variety of substructures in a single disk.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs36" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: Recent ALMA observations revealed concentric annular structures in several young class-II objects. In an attempt to produce the rings and gaps in some of these systems, they have been modeled numerically with a single embedded planet assuming a locally isothermal equation of state. This is often justified by observations targeting the irradiation-dominated outer regions of disks (approximately 100 au). We test this assumption by conducting hydrodynamics simulations of embedded planets in thin locally isothermal and radiative disks that mimic the systems HD 163296 and AS 209 in order to examine the effect of including the energy equation in a seemingly locally isothermal environment as far as planet–disk interaction is concerned. We find that modeling such disks with an ideal equation of state makes a difference in terms of the number of produced rings and the spiral arm contrast in the disk. Locally isothermal disks produce sharper annular or azimuthal features and overestimate a single planet’s gap-opening capabilities by producing multiple gaps. In contrast, planets in radiative disks carve a single gap for typical disk parameters. Consequently, for accurate modeling of planets with semimajor axes up to about 100 au, radiative effects should be taken into account even in seemingly locally isothermal disks. In addition, for the case of AS 209, we find that the primary gap is significantly different between locally isothermal and radiative models. Our results suggest that multiple planets are required to explain the ring-rich structures in such systems.

<tr bgcolor="#d3d7cf" class="abs37" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: The formation of the cores of giant planets was long though to happen 
through the accretion of planetesimals. However, the accretion of 
planetesimals renders core accretion times longer than the disc life 
time in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs. Instead, the 
accretion of mm-cm size particles, so called pebbles, can accelerate the 
process tremendously. When the planet reaches a mass of around 10 Earth 
masses, gas accretion can start and the planet can become as gas giant. 
At the same time, the planet interacts with the protoplanetary disc and 
migrates through it.
In this talk, I will first briefly review the concepts of pebble 
accretion. I will then show how giant planets can form in the models and 
how their subsequent evolution can be constraint by the observed 
eccentricity distribution of giant planets and their relation to 
super-Earths. In addition, I will show that the next step of planet 
formation simulations is to use disc observations as another constraint 
for planet population synthesis simulations.

<tr bgcolor="#eeeeec" class="abs38" style="display:none;"><td width="120px"></td><td></td><td>Abstract: In the core accretion scenario for giant planet formation a planetary embryo has to form in a proto-planetary disk by collisional growth and has to reach a critical mass sufficient enough to start runaway gas accretion on a timescale before the gas disk is dissipated. The critical mass needed is typically of the order of a few Earth masses. One idea to achieve this is pebble accretion: the accretion of small particles onto large bodies facilitated by the influence of gas drag. We implemented this accretion mechanism of dust particles onto planetary embryos into our dust coagulation models to investigate under which conditions and on what timescale giant planet cores can form in protoplanetary disks.

Many authors studying the pebble-driven planet growth set the size of pebbles and the pebble flux as arbitrary parameters, independent of the protoplanetary disk model. In this talk, I will present what comes out of connecting a self-consistent dust evolution model considering full size distribution obtained in detailed dust coagulation simulation and embryo growth by pebble accretion.
